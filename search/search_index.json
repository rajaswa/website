My expertise spans Agentic AI, AI for Programming, Multilingual NLP, and Speech/Natural Language Processing, underpinned by strong research foundations and practical engineering experience.</p> <p>I began my journey with part-time research work at leading research institutions, such as the Max Planck Institute, IIIT Delhi, BITS Pilani (Goa), and IIT Bombay, where I worked on Speech/Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science. This early AI research experience laid the foundation for my industry roles.</p> <p>At Postman, I led the architecture design and backend AI workflows for Postbot, an in-app Agentic AI Assistant for API workflows. As a part of this role, I also set up workflows for AI evaluations, data curation, model training, and feedback data analytics. At Microsoft PROSE, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Visual Studio team, contributing to the AI evaluation suite for Visual Studio's GitHub Copilot Chat extension.</p> <p>Prior to this, at TCS Research, I contributed to research on NLP for Programming, focusing on Text-to-SQL semantic parsing, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal document question answering. My short stint at Cognizer AI as a Data Scientist involved developing NLP models for the Cognizer Genius platform, specializing in tasks like question generation, grammar correction, and text simplification - addressing key needs in automation and language processing.</p> <p>Today, as an independent consultant, I specialize in building tailored AI solutions that align with my clients' business goals and maximize impact.</p> <p>Note: Please refer to my LinkedIn for further details on my experience.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"notes/","title":"Welcome to my Notebook","text":"<p>This is a space where I share thoughts, ideas, research, and explorations that intrigues me.
