With six years of focused experience in AI research and development, I have transitioned from an aspiring AI researcher to a full-time Applied AI Engineer and Consultant, delivering high-impact solutions across varied domains. My expertise spans **Agentic AI**, **AI for Programming**, **Multilingual NLP**, and **Speech/Natural Language Processing**, underpinned by strong research foundations and practical engineering experience.

I began my journey with part-time research work at leading research institutions, such as the [**Max Planck Institute**](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/language-cycles), [**IIIT Delhi**](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), [**BITS Pilani (Goa)**](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), and [**IIT Bombay**](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), where I worked on Speech/Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science. This early AI research experience laid the foundation for my industry roles.

At [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/), I led the architecture design and backend AI workflows for [**Postbot**](https://www.postman.com/product/postbot/), an in-app Agentic AI Assistant for API workflows. As a part of this role, I also set up workflows for AI evaluations, data curation, model training, and feedback data analytics. At [**Microsoft PROSE**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/), I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Visual Studio team, contributing to the AI evaluation suite for Visual Studio's [**GitHub Copilot Chat**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat?view=vs-2022) extension.

Prior to this, at [**TCS Research**](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research), I contributed to research on NLP for Programming, focusing on Text-to-SQL semantic parsing, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal document question answering. My short stint at [**Cognizer AI**](https://cognizer.ai/) as a Data Scientist involved developing NLP models for the [**Cognizer Genius**](https://cognizer.ai/genius) platform, specializing in tasks like question generation, grammar correction, and text simplification - addressing key needs in automation and language processing.

Today, as an independent consultant, I specialize in building tailored AI solutions that align with my clients' business goals and maximize impact.
